# Blockchain-ProofOfWork
Blockchain immutable, distributed database / Ledger of economic transactions which are secured using Cryptography.

Blockchain concepts are simillar to double-linked list data structure in C/C++.

Important Keywords in Blockchain:
1. Cryptography - Secure transactions using Hashing, Authenticated hashing/hmac and Digital Signature (Non-repudiation)
2. Immutable - achieved through Proof of Work by introducing Nonce (also called mining)
3. Distributed /Decentralized Ledger - Blockchain accepts transactions and allows us to mine (add) new Blocks. But the whole point of Blockchains is that they should be decentralized. And if they’re decentralized, need to ensure that they all reflect the same chain. This is called the problem of Consensus, and we’ll have to implement a Consensus Algorithm (Longest chain) if we want more than one node in our network.

4. Blockchain
